  Hi!
</Text>

I'm Fran Ortiz, a software engineer passionate about product development.

I love learning new concepts and sharing the most as I can so I decided to write this blog where you can find content
with some experiences and observations across the software development industry.

The main topic will be product development, mixing content about **product discovery** (learning about WHAT to do)
and **product delivery** (learning about HOW to do it).

Hi there!

I'm Fran Ortiz, a software engineer passionate about product development.

During my career, I have had the opportunity to build different products, trying to provide value by implementing
continuous learning cultures based on Extreme Programming (XP) and DevOps.

In this site, the main topic will be product development, mixing content about **product discovery** (learning about WHAT to do)
and **product delivery** (learning about HOW to do it).

### Contact
